# Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using linear regression. We analyze a dataset containing information about house sales in King County, USA. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts house prices and evaluate its performance.

## Steps in the Project

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

2. **Data Preprocessing**

3. **Building the Linear Regression Model**

4. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of predicting house prices using linear regression. It includes data analysis, model building, and evaluation to provide insights into the factors influencing house prices. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own analysis!
